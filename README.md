# Introduction
Learning Processing is an introductory workbook/textbook for Processing, which is built on top of Java.

There, however, is no Learning p5.js book, meaning there is no JavaScript-based version of Learning Processing.  There is just the Dan Shiffman repo of Learning Processing code ported to p5.js. Although [this book](https://www.springer.com/us/book/9781484234259?gclid=CjwKCAiA8bnUBRA-EiwAc0hZk7BwWdTn-f-2ELGoh1CwFpMvYHrMZH-0kV553OsjfIXqBFbaHyGQqxoCPkIQAvD_BwE#aboutBook) looks like it might be on target.

This repo is an attempt to solve that problem.  I will go through the Learning Processing book, link to the appropriate Shiffman p5.js repos from the Learning Processing book, link to the most relevant Coding Train videos, and post my own code for the exercises. 

I will also have the occasional "detour" when relevant topics come up that aren't covered in the book.  For instance, Command Line, using GitHub, etc.  These "detours" might end up overwhelming the initial goal of the project, but we'll see.

I think this will be helpful for my learning process, and I hope it's helpful to anyone else who stumbles across this repo.

I'm beginning to think this may become an open source project similar to [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) or [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/).

I'm thinking of calling it Space Bear. Or Coding Jet.

## What is p5.js?

See [this Coding Train video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8j0UDiN7my4&list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6Zy51Q-x9tMWIv9cueOFTFA) for Dan Shiffman's explanation of the origin of p5.js, and how to get started coding with p5.js.

Note that the above video references an editor for download that has since been [deprecated](https://github.com/processing/p5.js-editor).

Dan Shiffman's [next video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZ4D3wDRaec&list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6Zy51Q-x9tMWIv9cueOFTFA&index=2) is about a p5.js workflow, meaning how to download the project files, how to setup node.js and package manager, and how to run a local server on your computer.  I plan on going through all these steps later, but for now, I'm going to use the [online editor](https://alpha.editor.p5js.org/).

## Incremental Development

This is also known as the "one step at a time" approach.

This could also be called "top down design".

Don't try to do too much all at once.  Break a larger vision down into smaller parts and attack each piece slowly, one at a time.  

Space Invaders example: 
1. Program the spaceship
2. Program the invaders 
3. Program the scoring system 

(Editor's note - this may be a completely inappropriate project depending on the coder's skill level.  The philosophy of deliberate practice dictates that learning is best done through exercises that are challenging, but not too challenging.  I have found it very hard to find that proper balance in learning to code.  Either projects are too easy, or they're too difficult (and I don't have the network to ask for assistance when I hit a wall).  I'd love to find a way to bridge this gap and figure out difficulty appropriate projects.

See [this link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biN3v3ef-Y0) for Shiffman coding Space Invaders - it doesn't seem so beginner friendly)

Back to Space Invaders...

Then divide the problem into the smallest pieces necessary. Simple and easy steps will make programming the game seem more achievable (how you go about figuring out those steps is another important question).

We would break down Step 1 into six programs.  The first program would *display a triangle*.  Each step would add a small improvement.  The next would *move the triangle*.  

1. 1 Draw the triangle onscreen.  This is the spaceship.
1. 2 Position the triangle at the bottom of the screen.
1. 3 Position the triangle slightly to the right of where it was before.
1. 4 Animate the trangle so that it moves from position left to right.
1. 5 Animate the triangle from left to right only when the right-arrow key is pressed.
1. 6 Animate the triangle right to left when the left-arrow key is pressed.

(Of course, being able to figure out these steps assumes a ton of coding knowledge already.  If you can't figure out the order for these steps, or even what steps there should be in the first place, what chance do you have of writing the code to execute them?)

This makes programming and "debugging" easier - more on this next.

Incremental development also lends itself well to *object oriented programming*, which allows us to develop projects in modular pieces, meaning these pieces can be easily organized, shared, and reused.

## Debugging

See [this link](http://staging.p5js.org/tutorials/debugging.html) from p5.js and [this link](https://vimeo.com/105069079) from ITP for more info on debugging.

Note that a "bug" is "the moment when there is both a technical problem with your code as well as a problem with your mental picture of what is happening in your code."

I'd like to dive a little deeper than this.  

Most debugging lessons and tutorials that I have seen have focused on the above - namely first understanding what the code is doing before even trying to fix it.

This seems logical, but it forgets that fact that a true newbie might be totally lost in the woods.  Even if a newbie can understand what is going on in the code (a big if), this programmer might not have the skills to solve the problem.  Going beyond this, all of the steps that "worked" previously, might in fact be the cause of the current problem.  The newbie has no way of knowing whats going on.

Additionally, unless the newbie is in a course, or has another network to rely on, he or she is all alone to find the "bug".  This can end up being a hopeless endeavor.

This brings be back to my early point, which was the importance of finding projects at the right difficulty level.  Additionally, the newbie either needs to know how to find answers online (StackOverflow for instance), or needs a network of people to call on for assistance).  Otherwise there will be a string of failed projects.  


## Algorithms

Programming is all about writing algorithms.

An algorithm is a sequential list of instructions that solves a particular problem.  Incremental development should make it easier to write an algorithm that implements your idea.

(I have been wondering about the algorithm development process. How does one get good at developing basic algorithms, like the ones above for Space Invaders? Does it come with practice in programming? Is it an innate skill that people have, that perhaps they can hone - people who are good at math and logic games naturally become more adept at learning to write algorithms?  If you have taken a long break from doing anything quantitative, for instance adult learners, would they benefit from a crash course in Precalculus, or even Philosophy, to hone their logical thinking skills?  From a first principles perspective, how do you write those first lines of pseudocode that lead to a larger program? Is there a way to teach that, besides "write an algorithm to provide instructions on how to brush your teeth - this book's first exercise?)

See [this link](https://github.com/danweiner/learning-p5-js/blob/master/intro/touthbrush.txt) for my answer to toothbrushing algorithm exercise.


## Detour 1 - GitHub and Command Line

If you found this page, you must at least know how to find GitHub.  You might even have a GitHub profile.  Those are a good first steps.

Check out [this video series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6ZF9C0YMKuns9sLDzK6zoiV) by Dan Shiffman for a introduction to GitHub and Command Line.

I remember being very intimidated the first time working with Terminal.  That was a big deal for me.  The first real turning point towards being a "real" programmer.  Maybe you'll feel similarly.


# Lesson 1 - The Beginning

[Watch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1ELEeIs0j8&list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6Zy51Q-x9tMWIv9cueOFTFA&index=3) Foundations of Programming in JavaScript - p5.js, videos 1.3 - 2.1.  This covers pixels, drawing basics (shapes and colors), uploading p5.js sketches, and mouseX and mouseY variables.

## Basics of Drawing 

[Here](https://github.com/shiffman/LearningProcessing-p5.js/tree/master/chp01_drawing) are Dan Shiffman's repos for drawing basic shapes.  Note that these initial examples are written in the "setup" function.  This is because Dan is trying to follow the order of the book, where "static" sketches are taught first, and "flow" isn't introduced until chapter 3.

[Here](https://github.com/shiffman/LearningProcessing-p5.js/tree/master/chp02_processing/example_02_01_zoog) is Dan's static alien character sketch called "Zoog".

## Interaction

### Dynamic Sketches - Setup and Draw

Software happens over a *period of time* - we'll call this *flow*.

What is *Setup*?
- The set of initial conditions (in a game for instance - character name, score of zero, level 1...)
- This only happens one time

What is *Draw*?
- Happens after setup
- This cycles over and over again (ideally more than 30 times per second for smooth animation)
- In a game, this could be checking mouse moves, calculating behaviors of game characters, updating screen to render game graphics..
-This runs until the program quits

See [this link](https://github.com/shiffman/LearningProcessing-p5.js/tree/master/chp03_flow/example_03_01_setupdraw) for "Zoog" using setup and draw functions.

See [this link](https://github.com/danweiner/learning-p5-js/tree/master/ch-1-3/fido) for my first sketch in p5.js.  This was Exercise 3.2 in the Learning Processing book.  I have used the setup and draw functions.  The only shape functions I used were ellipses and rects.  I drew a dog called "Fido".

### Variations with the Mouse

Instead of typing numbers into our functions (rect, ellipse), we can type mouseX and mouseY - indicating the horizontal and vertical position of the mouse cursor.

Dan points out an interesting example of what happens when you place background in setup instead of draw.  He also discusses this in one of his videos.  If you place background in setup instead of draw, background is only drawn once.  This can be a good thing or a bad thing, depending on the intent of your program.  If you mean to design a painting program, this is great, because background is only drawn once, and every subsequent drawing function will be displayed on the canvas.  For instance, when that shape is moved, you will see a long trail of every time that shape is drawn on the canvas.  If you dont intendto show every time the shape is drawn on the canvas, you will need to put background into the draw function, so the background is redrawn each time the other shapes are inside draw.  As always, Dan does a better job of explaining this than I ever could.

The next exercise is to make our drawing move with the mouse.  Dan's [sketch](https://github.com/shiffman/LearningProcessing-p5.js/tree/master/chp03_flow/exercise_03_04_Zoog_mouse) is here.  

My [example](https://github.com/danweiner/learning-p5-js/tree/master/ch-1-3/ex-3.5-mouse_fido) is here.  Note that the book also mentions to vary the color depending on the mouse position, so I used colorMode() to make the min RGB the width of 0, and max RGB the canvas width, then I changed the fill of the eyes and noses depending on mouseX.

I struggled with this exercise a bit at first.  In particular, I struggled because I used push() and pop() for my sketch's rotated "ears" - see below.

Only after watching Dan's video on translate, rotate, etc, and translating the entire sketch (see this [repo](https://github.com/danweiner/learning-p5-js/tree/master/ch-1-3/fido_translate) first), was I able to complete exercise 3.5.

Note that Dan also has a sketch using [translate](https://github.com/shiffman/LearningProcessing-p5.js/tree/master/chp03_flow/example_03_07_translated_zoog), even though I don't think this is mentioned in the book.  

### Detour 2 - Translate, Rotate, Push, and Pop

Unlike "Zoog", my drawing required a special feature - rectangle shaped ears that were rotated related to the screen.  This relates back to a previous point that I made - not knowing what you're getting yourself into before starting a project.  I searched for "draw dog with simple shapes", found an image online of a dog made of circles and rectangles, and thought I could draw this in p5.js.  Of course it's not that easy.

In programming, [nothing is simple](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/one-does-not-simply-learn-to-code-f25bacdc5b62).  There is never a straight line to follow.  Everything that seems simple always becomes complicated.  Infinitely more so when you're a beginner and you are struggling to know where to begin the troubleshooting process.

Maybe some books on Zen and enjoying frustration / seeing obstacles as opportunities would be useful in a coding curriculum.  I've heard Prof. Eric Grimson of MIT use the phrase "opportunities for challenges".  Maybe that's a mindset any coder needs to embrace.  Something else to think about.

Luckily, I had already struggled a bit with transformations, rotations, push, and pop, so this was not completely foreign territory to me.  I was able to draw my sketch, rotated ears and all.  I wonder if this will affect future projects in future chapters.  That's always the worry.

See these Coding Train videos for Dan's lessons on [rotating images](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9sgjuh-CBM).

### pmouseX and pmouseY

These stand for "previous" mouseX and mouseY locations, meaning the last place the mouse was when we cycled through draw.

Examples of using pmouseX and pmouseY:
- draw a [continuous line](https://github.com/danweiner/learning-p5-js/tree/master/lesson-1/example-3.4-continuousline) - example 3.4
- Exercise 3.7 - write a [program](https://github.com/danweiner/learning-p5-js/tree/master/lesson-1/example-absval) where the faster the user moves the mouse,
the wider the line is drawn. Hint: look up strokeWeight( ) in the
p5.js reference.
  - The formula for calculating the speed of the mouse’s horizontal motion is the
absolute value of the difference between mouseX and pmouseX. The absolute value of a
number is defined as that number without its sign
  - The speed at which the mouse is moving is therefore:
  - abs(mouseX - pmouseX )

### Mouse Clicks and Key Presses

Mouse clicks are *events* - this means adding a new function separate from setup and draw

This new function will tell the program what code to execute when an event occurs.

Similar to setup, it will occur once and only once - for each occurence of the event - that event can of course happen multiple times over the course of the program.

Two new functions:
- mousePressed() - mouse clicks
- keyPressed() - key presses

This example demonstrates [both event functions](https://github.com/danweiner/learning-p5-js/tree/master/lesson-1/example-3.5-events) - adding squares whenever the ouse is pressed and clearing the background when a key is pressed.

frameRate() requires a integer between 1 and 60 and enforces the speed at which p5.js will cycle through draw().  frameRate(30) means 30 frames per second, the traditional speed for computer animation.  If you don't include frameRate(), p5 will attempt to run the sketch at 60 frames per second.  Since computers run at different speeds, framerate() is used to make sure that your sketch is consistent across multiple computers.

Here is Dan's [sketch](https://github.com/shiffman/LearningProcessing-p5.js/tree/master/chp03_flow/example_03_06_interactive_zoog) of interactive Zoog.  Zoog's entire body follows the mouse.  Its eye color is determined by the mouse location.  Its legs are drawn from the previous mouse location to the current mouse location.  Finally, when the mouse is clicked, the message is displayed in the console: "Take me to your leader!"

## Lesson 1 Project

The final project for this lesson is to draw a new sketch using everything we've learned from chapters 1 through 3.

This must include RGB colors, shapes, setup and draw, and some interaction using the mousePressed() or keyPressed() functions.

I drew a [sketch](https://github.com/danweiner/learning-p5-js/tree/master/lesson-1/lesson-1-project) of a house where the original scene is daytime, but when the mouse is pressed, it changes to nighttime.

I would need a variable to change it back to daytime with another mouse click, but that's the subject for the next lessons.

I also thought about using loops for things like drawing stars, and using the random function, but I decided to wait on that until those are brought up in the book.


# Lesson 2 - Everything you need to know

This section covers:
- Variables
- Conditionals
- Loops

## Chapter 4 - Variables

Overview:
- Variables: What are they?
- Declaring and initializing variables
- Common uses for variables
- "Built-in" variables
- Using random values for variables

This [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn_B3T_Vbxs&t=87s) is Dan's introduction to variables in p5.js.

### What is a Variable?

A laundry list of analogies to describe variables:
- a storage locker
- a bucket
- a post-it note

(Note how the lawyers in this $9 billion [case](https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/yp33dy/googles-lawyers-tried-to-explain-apis-to-a-jury-using-a-physical-filing-cabinet) tried to compare Java's APIs to a filing cabinet.  Explaining tech is hard.  That's why Coding Train is so great.)

The computer has memory.  A variable is a *named pointer* to a location in the computer's memory (a "memory address") where data is stored.

Computers only process one instruction at a time.  So, a variable allows a programmer to *save information* from one point in the program, and refer back to it at a later time.

Examples:
- variables can keep track of info related to shapes - color size, location
- make a triange change from blue to purple
- make a rectangle move across the screen
- make an ellipse shrink into nothingness

Dan say's he prefers the *piece of paper* approach: graph paper.  

Imagine the computer's memory as a sheet of graph paper, and each cell on the graph paper has an address.  With variables, we can name each of these cells.  

Let's name one "Dan's score" and give it the value of 100.  Then, when we want to use "Dan's score" in a progran, it's right there in memory.  We can just ask for it by the name "Dan's score".

The whole point of variables is that they *vary*.  

### Exercise 4.1 Variables in Pong

List of possible variables:
- Player 1 score
- Player 2 score
- time
- ball position (tracking ball movement)
- paddle position (tracking paddle movement)

Dan's [coding challenge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIrC5Qcb2G4) for Pong.

### Declaring, Initializing, and Using Variables

It's best to refer to Dan's video on variables, linked above.  The book discusses variables in Java, which have similarities, but can still be confusing because of the need to declare variable types.

Dan's first example, moving a circle across the screen, has a valuable lesson for debugging.  He repeats this phrase over and over, in slightly different versions.  "Let's predent we are the computer."  Or "be one with the computer."

I've written the [example](https://github.com/danweiner/learning-p5-js/tree/master/lesson-2/variables) here.  Even though this code is fairly straightforward, it's getting the student to start thinking like the computer. Thinking methodically, step by step, about how the computer is executing the code.  This will be crucial as code gets more complex.

Note how he also discusses the assignment operation in:

```circleX = circleX + 1```

It is difficult to think of this as an assignment operation (rather than "equals"), where the right side is evaluated and then "assigned" to the left side, but this is a critical concept to learn up front.

Examples [4.3](https://github.com/danweiner/learning-p5-js/tree/master/lesson-2/example-4.3) and [4.4](https://github.com/danweiner/learning-p5-js/tree/master/lesson-2/example-4.4) use variables to change the size, color, and location of shapes.

Exercises [4.4](https://github.com/danweiner/learning-p5-js/tree/master/lesson-2/exercise-4.4) for more practice with variables.

Dan is smart to have students first draw these sketches with hard coded values before replacing these values with variables.  Always start with the basics - make sure to get the basic drawing right first then move on to something a little more advanced like a new concept.


### System Variables

Just like mouseX and mouseY - these are commonly needed pieces of data associated with all sketches (width of window, key pressed on keyboard, etc.)

Avoid using system variable names when naming your own variables.

Commonly used system variables:
- width: Width (in pixels) of sketch window
- height: Height (in pixels) of sketch window
- frameCount: Number of frames processed
- frameRate: Rate that frames are processed (per second)
- screen.width: Width (in pixels) of entire screen
- screen.height: Height (in pixels) of entire screen
- key: most recent key pressed on keyboard
- keyCode: Numeric code for key pressed on keyboard
- keyPressed: True or false? Is a key pressed?
- mousePressed: True of false? Is the mouse pressed?
- mouseButton: Which button is pressed? Left, right, or center?

Here's an example using [system variables](https://github.com/danweiner/learning-p5-js/tree/master/lesson-2/example-4.5).

I don't think this is covered by any Coding Train videos.  See the videos above about mouseX and making your own variables.

Exercise 4.5, getting the shapes to resize themselves relative to the window size, did not work in the online editor.  I tried my code, and Dan's code in the learning p5.js repo.  I think the code might have worked in the deprecated p5.js editor (when a separate canvas launches, which can then be resized - similar to what happens with processing), but this does not happen with the online editor.

This was the best answer I could come up with.  I used windowWidth and windowHeight, instead of width and height (which are suggested in the book).  

In any event, this seemed like a good time for a detour.  I will now go through Dan's [workflow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZ4D3wDRaec&index=2&list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6Zy51Q-x9tMWIv9cueOFTFA) video to see if this code works in the browser on a local server.  It will also be a good test to see if I can execute the steps in his workflow video.  Here we go.

### Detour 3 - Workflow

First note - I could also try codepen.  I'll do that after this video.  Dan also mentioned Glitch.  I'll look into that as well.

Note that I'm using Sublime Text instead of Atom, so I downloaded the package [SublimeServer](http://learningcn.com/SublimeServer/) to turn Sublime into a server.  I remember I needed to first install [Package Control](https://packagecontrol.io/installation) in order to download things like SublimeServer.  If you're new to programming, you could definitely get stuck at this stage because it's confusing to navigate these kinds of setup details.

SublimeServer also does live reload, just like Dan's example in Atom.

This was successful - I even troubleshot package manager with Sublime Text.  :)

A few commands to remember:

```
p5 generate -b myproject

(node) http-server

python -m SimpleHTTPServer

```

### JavaScript Objects

The next chapter in the book Learning Processing is about using the random() function, but Coding Train has two videos before this.  One about [JavaScript Objects](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-e5h4IGKZRY&index=8&list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6Zy51Q-x9tMWIv9cueOFTFA) and the other about the [map function](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nicMAoW6u1g&list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6Zy51Q-x9tMWIv9cueOFTFA&index=9).  I'll follow the Coding Train curriculum and address these subjects before moving on to random().

Dan sets up an example of using variables and moving an ellipse across the screen.

He then will use an object to organize the variables.  This sets a foundation for later, and makes code more tidy, and keep track of what you're creating.

```
var x = 0;
var y = 100;
var diameter = 50;

//becomes...

var circle = {
	x: 0,
	y: 100;
	diameter: 50
};

```

This is JavaScript object notation.  We can access the circle's *data*.

We access this data using dot notation.  

`ellipse(circle.x, circle.y, circle.diameter, circle.diameter)`

The exercise is to reorganize our code using objects.  Here is [example 4.4 using objects]().

Dan also notes in this video that we should get very used to seeing error messages when writing code.  This is absolutely true.  How to debug those error messages is another story altogether...

### Random: Variety is the spice of life

Think back to incremental development - learn the fundamentals by looking at individual pieces - programs that do one and only one thing.  Then begin to add functionality on top, step by step.

random() returns a value - abs() does the same thing - more on this in Chapter 7
