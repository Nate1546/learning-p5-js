# learning-p5-js

The Learning Processing book is meant for Processing, which is built on top of Java.

There, however, is no JavaScript based version of Learning Processing; in other words there is no Learning p5.js book, just the Dan Shiffman repo of Learning Processing code ported to p5.js.

This repo is an attempt to solve that problem.  I will go through the Learning Processing book, link to the appropriate Shiffman p5.js repos from the Learning Processing book, link to the most relevant Coding Train videos, and post my own code for the exercises. 

I think this will be helpful for my learning process, and I hope it's helpful to anyone else who stumbles across this repo.


# Part 1 - What is p5.js

See [this Coding Train video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8j0UDiN7my4&list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6Zy51Q-x9tMWIv9cueOFTFA) for Dan Shiffman's explanation of the origin of p5.js, and how to get started coding with p5.js.

Note that the above video references an editor for download that has since been [deprecated](https://github.com/processing/p5.js-editor).

Dan Shiffman's [next video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZ4D3wDRaec&list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6Zy51Q-x9tMWIv9cueOFTFA&index=2) is about a p5.js workflow, meaning how to download the project files, how to setup node.js and package manager, and how to run a local server on your computer.  I plan on going through all these steps later, but for now, I'm going to use the [online editor](https://alpha.editor.p5js.org/).
