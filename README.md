# learning-p5-js

The Learning Processing book is meant for Processing, which is built on top of Java.

The community seems to have shifted to p5.js, which is Processing ported over to JavaScript.

There, however, is no Learning p5.js book, just the Shiffman repo of Learning Processing code ported to p5.js.

Additionally, there is no resource that brings together the Coding Train videos with the associated Learning Processing p5.js code, along with sample student code from the book exercises.

So, that is the goal of this project.  I will go through the Learning Processing book, link to the appropriate Shiffman p5.js repos from the Learning Processing book, link to the most relevant Coding Train videos, and post my own code for the exercises.  

I think this will be helpful for my learning process, and I hope it's helpful to anyone else who stumbles across this repo.
